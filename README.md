# Managers Path Chapter 3 - Tech Lead

You don’t have to be the most senior. It helps to be:
- A good communicator (internal and cross-team)
- Able to write clear documents
- Give presentations
- Able to prioritize

Not all problems are technical problems. A floundering tech lead may make this mistake and miss all the other things going on (commitments, communication...)

“My job as tech lead was to continue to write code, but with the added responsibilities of representing the group to management, vetting our plans for feature delivery, and dealing with a lot of the details of the project management process.” - p. 28

Who is a tech lead and what do they do?
- Tech lead can be any level engineer and can be picked up at different points in an engineers career.
- It may or may not involve people management
- Being a tech lead is more about people and project management than it is about technical skill.

Example tech lead decision: Making the decision to stop new feature work to pay down debt. The payoff? Feature work slowdown at first, but greater output in the future. Increased developer happiness. A good teach lead needs to recognize this kind of thing and be able to convince others it’s the best course of action.

Tech lead must:
- Be able to step away from the code and perform the non-coding work your team needs
- Need to balance your time between a maker’s schedule and a manager’s schedule (beware of being pulled into meetings)

## Being a Tech Lead 101

### Systems architecture and business analyst

- Identify changes that need to be made and features that need to be built
- What is needed:
  - a good sense of the overall architecture of your systems and a solid understanding of how to design complex software
  - understand business requirements and translate them into software
- Goal: Have enough clarity to estimate

### Project Planner

- Break work down into rough deliverables
- Goal: Break the work up so the team can work on it in parallel.
- What is needed:
 - input from the experts on your team
 - Identify long lead items ASAP to start work on them early

### Software Developer and team lead

- Write code, communicate challenges, delegate
- Goal: Build the project and watch out for missing possible deliverables
- What is needed:
  - Writing code
  - Ability to delegate work
  - Ability to identify things that are taking longer than expected and flag to product for possible negotiation / compromise

Becoming a tech lead is taking on the stone of triumph:

## Managing Projects

- Need to figure out dependencies, think of testing, does anything need to be bought?, what’s the timeline?... Then you need to be able to explain this to technical and non-technical people alike.
- Some projects that are farther reaching than a sprint or two really need this sort of planning
- THIS IS NOT ALWAYS NEEDED, but it is needed for larger projects:
  - Examples:
    - Assignments
    - V1 Registrar
    - Enrollment Unification
- Keep in mind, even though our managers a very skilled technically, they don’t just ‘get it’. We need to explain things plainly and clearly and should not assume others understand without explanation.

## Managing a Project

- Break down the work
  - Break the large deliverables into tasks. This can be multiple steps (breaking deliverable into parts, then breaking those into ticket sizes tasks…)
- Push through the details and the unknowns
  - Keep asking questions until you cannot gain any more value about the unknown
- Run the project and adjust the plan as you go
  - Keep track of your milestones so when things slip, you can still clearly describe how far you’ve come and how far you have left to go
- Use the insights gained in the planning process to manage requirement changes
  - As things change, make sure to apply the learnings from your planning and ensure the stakeholders are clear about the cost of the changes
- Revisit the details as you get close to completion
  - At wrap up, check for what’s missing, testing, verification?
  - Understand what ‘good enough’ is and cut the rest

## Decision Point: Stay on the Technical Track or Become a Manager

### Senior IC - Imagined

![Senior IC - Imagined](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/2258296/blog-images/team-rental/10xProgrammer_WSmod.png)

- Spending time deep thinking along and with others
- Building the coolest stuff and getting a lot of say in what you work on
- Only brought in for important meetings and don’t need to stay late
- Write books, give talks…

### Senior IC - Real

![Senior IC - Real](http://www.bennorthrop.com/Essays/2016/old-programmer.jpg)

- Great when you find the right project(s) - but they’re hard to find and you have to find them
- Need to do a lot of selling to build something and to help others use the new tool/system/language…
- You always feel like you’re missing out on the important meetings and going to the boring meetings

### Manager - Imagined

![Manager - Imagined](https://i.udemycdn.com/course/750x422/1787224_25ae_2.jpg)

- You run a team that respects you and does exactly what you say
- Your team is open with you and you’re open with them about feedback and you can really see the impact of your coaching
- Other managers listen to you because your team runs so well

### Manager - Real Life

![Manager - Real Life](https://www.liveseysolar.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/manager.jpg)

- Getting people to do things is harder than just telling them to
- You’ve totally lost control of your day to day to meetings
- No real time to write code, the best you can do is write a script of solve a bug ticket
- It’s tough to motivate the team through tough periods and people don’t even always tell you when they’re unhappy.
- Other managers don’t want your feedback and they see it as competition

Hey, it’s OK to try out one track and then switch.

## Good Manager, Bad Manager: The Process Czar

![process](https://media.giphy.com/media/wKBML22yhjFja/giphy.gif)

- The person that believes there is one true way to run a project (agile, scrum, kanban...).
- They can get frustrated when others are not as good at following process as they are
- Tend to focus on metrics (hours in the office, SLOC…) and don’t see qualitative things
- When this person becomes tech lead, they tend to spend too much time looking for ‘the right tool for the job’
- Be careful of relying on process to solve problems that are a result of communication or leadership gaps on your team. - p. 46
- Process that has to be manually enforced is hard to follow. See if the process can be changed to make it easier to follow (or harder to not follow)

## How to Be a Great Tech Lead

- Understand the Architecture: If you don’t understand it, take the team to learn it, visualize it, understand the connections…
- Be a Team Player: Don’t take all the interesting work for yourself. Help unstick the team with the boring bits. Vice versa, don’t do all the boring work.
- Lead Technical Decisions: Need to balance making the decision and involving the rest of the team. Some decisions you need to make on your own, but other times you need more input.
- Communicate: You need to be the voice of the team in meetings and you need to make sure you communicate the important information back to them. “Your productivity is now less important than the productivity of the whole team.” - p. 47

## Assessing your Own Experience

- Does your organization have tech leads? Is there is a written job description for this role? If so, what does it say? If not, how would you define the role in your organization? How would a tech lead define the role?
- If you are considering becoming a tech lead, are you ready to push yourself? Are you comfortable spending some of your time outside of the code? Do you feel like enough of an expert in your code base to successfully lead others as they work in it?
- Have you asked your manager what he or she expects from the tech lead?
- Who is the best tech lead you ever worked with? What are some things that person did that made him or her great?
- Have you worked with a frustrating tech lead? What did he or she do that frustrated you?
